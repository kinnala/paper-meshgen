* A simple technique for unstructured mesh generation via adaptive finite elements

This repository contains the LaTeX source for the manuscript "A simple technique
for unstructured mesh generation via adaptive finite elements" by T. Gustafsson,
and the Python source code for the computational examples included in the
manuscript.

- paper/ contains the LaTeX source.
- examples/example_fipy.py is based on the Stokes cavity example
  (https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/examples/flow/generated/examples.flow.stokesCavity.html)
  of FiPy. The example is licensed under the FiPy license; see the docstring of
  the file for more details.
- examples/example_meshes.ipynb generates the rest of the example meshes.
